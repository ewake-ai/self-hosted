# App you already have, or leave them null and register one from the dashboard, which writes this
# same path itself from what GitHub returns. Nothing here records which happened: the dashboard
# resolves the secret when it needs it, so an App registered after the apply needs no plan and no
# restart. `${ssm_path}/*` in iam.tf already carries the grant that lets it write.
#
# All three or none. Two of the three would leave the dashboard offering to register an App while
# your tfvars say you already have one, so terraform refuses the plan instead.
#
# Deliberately not under ${ssm_path}/integrations/: the application creates and deletes secrets
# under that prefix at runtime, and would fight terraform over one placed there.
#
# `sensitive` keeps the private key out of plan output and the console, not out of the state
# file. A backend holding this wants encryption and restricted reads.
